# Todo App

# Description:

I decided to build a simple Todo app after taking a few code challenges.  I incorporated the features these code challenges were requesting.

Images of the project are located in the public folder under projectImages.

## Some of those features include:

* Pagination - having the ability to only render a certain amount of data and then clicking on a "next" button to render the next set of data.  This also includes a "previous" button.
  - Must have 5 todo's for the buttons to appear.
* Pagination page numbers to easily page through todos.
* Displaying data in a usable way.
* Adding/Deleting data.
* Usage of React Hooks.
* Using forms and inputs.
* Managing state between components
* Conditionally styling and/or rendering components

## I also decided I wanted to add some additional features

### Completed features...

* The ability to sort todos by title and due date.
* Having the capability to switch between completed and in progress todos.
* Being able to Edit a todo.
* Creating and using a modal with createPortal.
* Adding modal messages directing user what to do.

### In progess features...

* Creating notifications that a todo is due soon.
* ~~Converting to use React and Typescript~~
* Using a state management tool like Redux, Conext, or the useReducer hook.
* Adding a calculator I made as an additional feature
* Timestamp edits so the user knows when they edited a todo.

### Bugs and other update needs I noticed...

* Clean up CSS and make selector names more relevant to the where they are located.
* Optimize CSS for mulitple media sizes and cross browser compatibility.
* The edit form doesnt give the ability to add to data already in the form or to add additional notes.
* If you complete todos on the second page the buttons disappear and you aren't able to get to the other todos.

## After these features and bugs are complete my plans are to add....

* Adding a login form that includes authentication.
* Adding a navbar that is personalized for each use that is signed in.
* Using a database for the data.
* Utilizing node.js for the backend.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
